# Changelog

## 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **All app state now lives in one Local AppData folder**: config, shop session,
  and the FrostMod install moved from Roaming to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.frost.mxbikes\` (joining the existing cache), so everything
  is in one per-machine place. No migration (pre-release) — old Roaming files are
  simply re-created on next launch.

### Added
- **Rider content**: a new **Rider** browse section (Rider Kit, Helmets, Helmet
  Paints, Gloves, Boots, Protection) installing into `mods/rider`. Paints route to
  the right place automatically — helmet/boot/protection paints into their model's
  `paints`/`goggles` (pick the installed model, name-matched like bike liveries),
  and rider outfit + gloves into the rider **profile** you choose
  (`riders/<profile>/{paints,gloves}`, scanned from your install via a new
  `scan_rider_targets` command).
- **File logging**: added `tauri-plugin-log`, writing to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.frost.mxbikes\logs\`. Startup logs the app version and the
  data/log dir paths, and shop session/login/download failures are now logged.

### Added
- **First-launch welcome tour**: a 3-slide intro overlay (what MXB App is →
  browse & install → FrostMod) shown once on first launch before folder setup,
  tracked via a `mxb:welcomeSeen:v1` localStorage flag. New
  `Components/Welcome/Welcome.tsx`.
- **Windows executable publisher & metadata**: the installer and the `.exe`
  version info now carry a publisher ("Frost"), copyright, homepage and
  description so Windows shows a proper publisher/details instead of blanks.
  Set via `bundle.publisher`/`copyright`/`homepage`/`shortDescription`/
  `longDescription` in `tauri.conf.json`. (Does not replace Authenticode code
  signing — SmartScreen may still warn until the exe is signed.)

- **Rich library cards from inside the `.pkz`**: plain-zip tracks and
  bikes now show their **real name, author, length and a preview thumbnail** read
  straight from the archive's `.ini` and preview image, plus the **file size** on
  every card. Preview images (often TGA, which browsers can't render) are decoded
  and downscaled to a small JPEG in Rust. **non-plain `.pkz` are
  detected and skipped gracefully** — they show a lock badge with just name + size.
  Parsing is lazy per card (list paints instantly) and cached to disk. Backed by a
  new `get_pkz_meta` Tauri command + `pkz` module (`image`/`base64` crates), with
  `size` added to the `InstalledMod` model.

- **MX Bikes Shop downloads**: a new **Shop** tab lets you sign in to
  mxbikes-shop.com and install the tracks you've **already purchased**
  ("All My Downloads") with the same one-click download → extract → place flow and
  "Installed" badge as Browse. Sign-in happens in a real WebView window (your
  password never touches the app); the captured session is persisted so you stay
  logged in across restarts, with a Log out button. Backed by new `shop_*` Tauri
  commands, an authenticated shared `reqwest` client, and a reusable
  `download_and_place` install helper shared with the free catalog.

### Fixed
- **Install destination picker for bike liveries**: the folder list is now
  **scrollable** and no longer overflows the popup, long bike names **truncate**
  instead of cutting off, and it's a **command-style search** — probable bikes
  (matched from the mod name) show under "Probably" at the top, with a search box
  to find any bike.

### Added
- **Start FrostMod without restarting the app**: if FrostMod isn't running, a play
  button appears on the sidebar status pill and in Settings → FrostMod to launch it
  on the spot.

### Added
- **FrostMod is managed in-app**: MXB App now **downloads FrostMod** from its GitHub
  releases, **runs `frostmod.exe`** hidden in the background so it's connected as
  soon as the app opens, and **updates** it — no manual setup. Settings → FrostMod
  shows the installed vs latest version with an Install / Update button and a
  "Run FrostMod automatically" toggle, and a first-run prompt offers to set it up.
  The managed process is stopped on a real Quit. (Injector is Windows-only; the
  manager no-ops elsewhere.)
- **Runs in the background like Discord**: closing the window now hides MXB App to
  a **system-tray icon** (Show / Quit menu) instead of quitting, so it keeps running
  and FrostMod stays connected. **Launches at login** by default. Both are
  toggleable in Settings → **General** ("Keep running in the background", "Launch at
  startup"). Backed by a tray icon + `WindowEvent::CloseRequested` intercept and the
  `tauri-plugin-autostart` plugin; prefs persist in the app config (default ON).
- **"Made with ❄ by Frost"** credit in Settings → About, linking to the author.

### Changed
- **Release assets get clean names**: a CI finalize step renames the ugly
  `MXB.App_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` to `MXB-App-0.1.0-x64.exe` (and the `.dmg`
  likewise) and repoints `latest.json`, so downloads look trustworthy. Signatures
  are over file content, so self-update still verifies.

## 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Windows install wizard**: the Windows build now ships a branded **NSIS**
  installer (welcome → license → install → finish) instead of a bare bundle.
  Installs **per-user with no admin/UAC** prompt, uses the snowflake app icon, and
  shows the MIT license. Configured in `tauri.conf.json` (`bundle.windows.nsis`);
  MSI dropped from the targets.
- **Auto-update**: the app checks GitHub Releases on launch (quietly) and offers
  **"Restart & update"** via a toast when a newer signed build exists; a manual
  **Check for updates** button lives in Settings → About. Backed by the Tauri
  `updater` + `process` plugins, signed release artifacts (`createUpdaterArtifacts`),
  and a `latest.json` published by CI. Requires the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
  secret and a published release to take effect.
- **App icon**: a snowflake mark on an icy gradient badge, generated into
  `src-tauri/icons/*` (`.ico`, `.icns`, PNGs) — this is what shows on the
  taskbar/dock and the `.exe`. The in-app UI is unchanged.
- **Platform-adaptive title bar**: on macOS the window now uses native
  decorations with `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` (new `tauri.macos.conf.json`), so
  it gets real traffic-lights, rounded corners and the native shadow, and our
  custom window buttons are hidden. Windows keeps the frameless custom title bar
  and its Windows-style controls, unchanged.
- README: roadmap entries for **bike + rider liveries** and **auto-update**.

### Fixed
- The product name still read "MXB App by Frost" in `productName` (the name shown
  on the taskbar and the installed `.exe`) and in the window title — both are now
  **MXB App**. Remaining in-app copy that called the app "Frost" (title bar,
  Setup, install/blocked-host text) now says **MXB App**. (FrostMod, the separate
  live-reload tool, keeps its name.)

### Changed
- README tech stack updated to Tailwind + shadcn/ui + lucide + Sonner (was MUI).

## 2026-07-13

### Added
- **UI redesign**: a dark, Apple-clean rebuild of the whole UI on Tailwind +
  shadcn/ui, replacing MUI. A permanent **left sidebar** (Browse / Library /
  Settings) with a live install badge, a persistent **global install indicator**
  and **FrostMod status pill** that survive navigation, and the game path.
- **Settings screen** (new): game folder (change / auto-detect + re-scan),
  appearance (Light / Dark / System theme), FrostMod status + reload, and about.
- **Install popup** on "Add to Library": pick the destination folder (with mod
  counts, remembered per category) and choose a download mirror (default
  pre-selected, browser-only hosts flagged) before installing.
- **Toast notifications** (bottom-right) for install success/failure and
  uninstall, replacing inline alerts.
- **Library actions**: per-mod context menu with Move to folder, **Show in
  Explorer**, and **Uninstall** (moves the file to the Recycle Bin via new
  `reveal_in_explorer` / `uninstall_mod` Tauri commands + the `trash` crate).
- **Mod Detail** right-rail install surface with a live stage chain
  (Resolve → Download → Extract → Place → Reload) and a guided 2-step
  blocked-host flow for browser-only mirrors.
- README release badges: latest release, release date, and total download count
  (dynamic via shields.io, GitHub-backed), plus MIT license and Windows x64
  platform badges. Added a root `LICENSE` file (MIT).
- **FrostMod live-reload integration**: when you add a mod, the app now signals a
  running [FrostMod](https://github.com/Frostn1/frostmod) to re-scan the mods
  folder so new tracks/bikes appear in-game without a restart. Works by setting
  FrostMod's own `Local\FrostModReload` Windows event (the same trigger as
  pressing **R** in its console) — no changes to FrostMod required. The mod
  detail view shows whether FrostMod picked it up live or isn't running, and new
  `frostmod_reload` / `frostmod_running` commands back a manual trigger + status.

- **Right-click actions**: right-clicking a mod in **Browse** offers *Quick
  install*, *Open details*, and *Select*; right-clicking a row in **Library**
  opens the same Move / Show in Explorer / Uninstall menu as the 3-dot button.
- **Quick install**: installs a mod straight from Browse with no detail page and
  no dialog — it resolves the best direct mirror and reuses the remembered (or
  auto-guessed) destination folder, then reports where it landed via a toast.
  Browser-only hosts (MediaFire/Mega) can't install silently and are skipped
  with an explanation.
- **Multi-select + bulk install** in Browse: select mods via the card checkbox or
  the right-click menu, then *Quick install N* from the selection bar
  (with *Select all* / *Clear*).
- **Install queue**: installs still run strictly one at a time, but extra
  requests now queue and drain in order, with a "+N queued" line on the sidebar's
  install card.

### Fixed
- Mod Detail screenshots rendered squashed: the gallery and thumbnail strip are
  flex children of a scrolling column, so they were being **shrunk** instead of
  scrolled and lost their 16:9 height. Pinned them with `flex-none`.
- The **GitHub / Changelog links in Settings** pointed at a non-existent
  `Frostn1/frost` repo — corrected to `Frostn1/mxb-app`, and the About line now
  reads "mxb-app" rather than the old product name.
- MediaFire mods were mis-detected as auto-installable because the host label is
  written "Media Fire" (with a space) — downloads are now classified by **URL**,
  so blocked hosts correctly open in the browser instead of failing.

### Changed
- Navigation moved from top tabs to the left **sidebar**; the theme toggle moved
  from the title bar into Settings → Appearance. **Setup** is now a single step.
- Clearer download UI: one **official one-click** option; other links are labeled
  (a dedicated-**server** build is called out as "not needed for normal play"
  rather than "mirror"); the **Import** step only appears when a blocked host is
  used.
- Enabled **text selection** and added a **Copy** button on error messages.

### Removed
- MUI, Emotion, and all per-component SCSS; the top-tab `Header`, the `Footer`,
  and the old `LoginPage`/theme are replaced by the sidebar shell, Settings, and
  a token-based Tailwind theme.

## 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Release CI** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): tagging `v*` (or a manual
  dispatch) builds Windows + macOS bundles with `tauri-action` and attaches the
  installers to a draft GitHub Release.
- **Import a file**: for hosts that block in-app downloads, open the download in
  the browser then import the downloaded file — the app extracts and places it
  into the right folder just like a normal install (`import_file` command).
- Download retries and full error-cause reporting on failed installs.

### Fixed
- Diagnosed installs failing with "error sending request for url …":
  **MediaFire's download CDN blocks all non-browser TLS clients** (verified
  across rustls, native-tls/SChannel, curl and Python — only real browsers get
  through). No TLS backend can bypass it, so MediaFire/Mega now fall back to
  browser download + Import. Auto-installable hosts (**Google Drive**, direct
  links) are shown first as the one-click option.

### Changed
- README: added Download, build-status badge, and Releases (how to cut one)
  sections.
- Renamed the app to **MXB App by Frost** (window title, title bar, header).
- Replaced the macOS traffic-light window buttons with **clean Windows-style
  controls** (minimize / maximize / close, red close hover).
- The Library now scans **recursively** and lists every installed `.pkz` with
  its sub-folder, so tracks/bikes nested inside folders show up.
- Kept **rustls** TLS (native-tls's SChannel failed the handshake on Windows).

## 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Browse & search** mods from mxb-mods.com in-app, with category filters,
  **"Load more" pagination**, and a mod detail page with an image gallery.
- **Add to Library**: one-click download → extract → place into the MX Bikes
  folder, with live progress. Resolves MediaFire and Google Drive links
  (including large-file virus-scan confirmation); extracts `.zip`/`.7z`/`.rar`
  and places `.pkz` files.
- Multiple download hosts on a page are shown as a primary "Add to Library"
  button plus per-host mirrors.
- **Bikes** mod type alongside Tracks, via a type switcher in the header;
  Browse, install, and Library are all per-type.
- **"In library" badges** on browse cards and the detail page (fuzzy name match
  against installed files).
- Loading skeletons, an error "Retry" button, and persisted light/dark theme.
- HTTP timeouts (30s API, 15s connect) for resilience.
- Swappable `ModSource` trait in the Rust backend (mxb-mods.com implementation
  via the WordPress REST API + download-page HTML parsing).
- Native folder picker for choosing the MX Bikes path during setup.
- Rust unit tests for REST/HTML parsing and download-link resolution.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and a real `README.md`.

### Changed
- **Upgraded Tauri v1 → v2** (config schema, capabilities/permissions, plugin
  system; `shell` + `dialog` plugins).
- **Converted the frontend from JavaScript to TypeScript** (typed API layer and
  shared types mirroring the Rust structs).
- Rebranded the app to **Frost** (was "MXBMM" / "The MXB App").
- Install placement is generalized to a per-type subfolder (`mods/tracks`,
  `mods/bikes`), configurable in one place in the frontend.
- Config now lives in the OS app-config dir instead of a cwd-relative
  `.config.json`.
- The Library is a proper per-type grid with manual refresh.
- Updated dependencies (MUI 6, React 18.3, Vite 5, current Tauri 2 stack).

### Removed
- Unused dependencies: Mantine (`@mantine/*`, `postcss-preset-mantine`), `axios`,
  and `path-browserify`.
- Dead/broken `src-tauri/src/config.rs` (replaced with a working config module)
  and a stale `.config.json` dev artifact.
