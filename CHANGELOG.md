# Changelog

## 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Installs failing with "error sending request for url …" on MediaFire/CDN
  downloads: switched to the OS-native TLS stack (SChannel on Windows,
  SecureTransport on macOS) instead of rustls, added download retries, and now
  surface the underlying error cause instead of a generic message.

### Changed
- Renamed the app to **MXB App by Frost** (window title, title bar, header).
- The Library now scans **recursively** and lists every installed `.pkz` with
  its sub-folder, so tracks/bikes nested inside folders show up.

### Added
- **Browse & search** mods from mxb-mods.com in-app, with category filters,
  **"Load more" pagination**, and a mod detail page with an image gallery.
- **Add to Library**: one-click download → extract → place into the MX Bikes
  folder, with live progress. Resolves MediaFire and Google Drive links
  (including large-file virus-scan confirmation); extracts `.zip`/`.7z`/`.rar`
  and places `.pkz` files.
- Multiple download hosts on a page are shown as a primary "Add to Library"
  button plus per-host mirrors.
- **Bikes** mod type alongside Tracks, via a type switcher in the header;
  Browse, install, and Library are all per-type.
- **"In library" badges** on browse cards and the detail page (fuzzy name match
  against installed files).
- Loading skeletons, an error "Retry" button, and persisted light/dark theme.
- HTTP timeouts (30s API, 15s connect) for resilience.
- Swappable `ModSource` trait in the Rust backend (mxb-mods.com implementation
  via the WordPress REST API + download-page HTML parsing).
- Native folder picker for choosing the MX Bikes path during setup.
- Rust unit tests for REST/HTML parsing and download-link resolution.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and a real `README.md`.

### Changed
- **Upgraded Tauri v1 → v2** (config schema, capabilities/permissions, plugin
  system; `shell` + `dialog` plugins).
- **Converted the frontend from JavaScript to TypeScript** (typed API layer and
  shared types mirroring the Rust structs).
- Rebranded the app to **Frost** (was "MXBMM" / "The MXB App").
- Install placement is generalized to a per-type subfolder (`mods/tracks`,
  `mods/bikes`), configurable in one place in the frontend.
- Config now lives in the OS app-config dir instead of a cwd-relative
  `.config.json`.
- The Library is a proper per-type grid with manual refresh.
- Updated dependencies (MUI 6, React 18.3, Vite 5, current Tauri 2 stack).

### Removed
- Unused dependencies: Mantine (`@mantine/*`, `postcss-preset-mantine`), `axios`,
  and `path-browserify`.
- Dead/broken `src-tauri/src/config.rs` (replaced with a working config module)
  and a stale `.config.json` dev artifact.
